// DO NOT REQUIRE jQuery or jQuery-ujs in this file!
// DO NOT REQUIRE TREE!

// All webpack assets in development will be loaded via webpack dev server
// It's important to include them in layout view above this asset
// b/c it exposes jQuery for turbolinks and another non-webpack JS (if any)

// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
